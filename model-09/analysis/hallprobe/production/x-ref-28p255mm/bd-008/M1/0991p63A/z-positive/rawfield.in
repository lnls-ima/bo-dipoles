# ==========================

# --- Summary ---
#
# this is the input file for fac-fma-rawfield.py script
# this script reads a fieldmap from a 3D magnet model, stores it
# for latter analysis and prints and plots basic information on the
# field map. It is used to quickly inspect the fieldmap


# --- Input parameters ---

# each analysis has an identity label used for naming output files

  config_label             'model-09-3GeV'


# the next parameter specifies the type of magnet to be analysed.
# each type may have its own particular algorithms to be applied

  magnet_type              'dipole'


# the full name of the file that contains the field map

  fmap_filename            '/home/fac_files/lnls-ima/bo-dipoles/model-09/measurement/magnetic/hallprobe/production/bd-008/M1/2017-03-08_BD-008_Model09_Hall_I=991.63A.dat'

# Runge-Kutta algorithm used for the integration of the eqs. of motion needs to know
# what to do when trajectory reaches the fieldmap bounds. It will either extrapolate the field
# along the longitudinal (z) direction or consider it to have vanished. This is controlled with
# the parameter below. Bear in mind that the calculation of extrapolation coefficients is very
# time-consuming currently. As for the transverse directions (x and y), the RK algorithm will
# generate exceptions.

  fmap_extrapolation_flag  False
